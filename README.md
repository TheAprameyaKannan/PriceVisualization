# PriceVisualization

This program uses beautiful soup to scrape the prices of two different products
The prices are written into a csv file and read by a pandas dataframe
The prices are plotted against each other using matplotlib 
Using a periodic lambda function on AWS, users can analyze trends between the prices of the products over time
